Created a Malware Analysis Lab that includes the following VMs:

REMnux 
FLARE-VM (win10)

Creating a host only virtual adapter in Virtual box to put both VMs.

#Do no leave the VMs with a NAT adapter!

We will use FLARE VM for host-based indicators and REMnux for netwwork-based indicators.

#Start inetsim on REMnux to simulate internet connection.
