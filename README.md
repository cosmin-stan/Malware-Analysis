Most of the analysis is done on the Flare-VM, gathering host indicators.
Remnux VM is used as a DNS service for Flare-VM, it runs inetsim to simulate an environment with internet connection.
Also, it is useful to gather network indicators from malware samples.

Analysis info are in the Malware folder
