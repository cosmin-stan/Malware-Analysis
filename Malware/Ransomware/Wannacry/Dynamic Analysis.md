On the Dynamic Analysis part, I used <b>Procmon</b> to identify host indicators:

We executed our sample (Ransomware.wannacry.exe.malz) on the FLARE-VM

Wannacry Ransomware writes on the host an executable and it is used as a second-stage malware:

The folder is located in the following folder

`C:\ProgramData\ytbjymfcjoghel136\tasksche.exe`

Checking Services from Task Manager, I noticed that Wannacry establish its persistence by installing a service in case of restart.

We can also notice that Suspicious URL from the Floss output in the <b>Wireshark</b>:

Checking the <b>TCPView</b>

The executable makes some TCP calls to an IP on port 445. (that IP from the image above it is not the actual malicious IP, it is generated automatically when the DHCP server is not reachable)

Wannacry takes advantance of the Eternal Blue exploit to spread throughout the network, it is still one of the most commonly attempted exploits against SMB, accounting for over 91.88% of the attacks on port 445 (the most common SMB port).
